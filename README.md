AnkiNotebooks
===

This is currently a non-functional skeleton for a project idea:

1. Export anki decks to .docx files
2. Import .docx files to anki
3. Synchronize decks and docx files in real time.

The goal is so that one can create, edit, and read flashcards in Word or other software.

The format of the .docx file is in a conceptual stage at this point and subject to change.
