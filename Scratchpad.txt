This file is just me looking through the anki source code trying to figure
out how to accomplish what I want. This may be inaccurate.

Roughly how to add a card to a the current deck with current? model

This is the method done for a single card. When importing, anki 
adds a bunch of notes with a direct db insert and then calls gen cards

It might be worth it to simply write a custom anki importer. Though this would
not allow the granular update functionality I am considering for later.


# seems we need to set all the fields to a default
    note = self.mw.col.newNote()
        flds = note.model()['flds']
        # copy fields from old note
        if oldNote:
            if not keep:
                self.removeTempNote(oldNote)
            for n in range(len(note.fields)):
                try:
                    if not keep or flds[n]['sticky']:
                        note.fields[n] = oldNote.fields[n]
                    else:
                        note.fields[n] = ""
                except IndexError:
                    break

# required?
note.model()['did'] = self.deckChooser.selectedId()


cards = col.addNote(note) # assuming for now this creates cards
if not cards:
    # do something if no return

col.autosave # writes db transaction and opens a new one if 5 mins has elapsed


=====================
HOW DO I CREATE A NEW DECK?

# could it be this simple? seems so
# where deck = "Name of Deck"
# but what checks are there if I enter invalid deck names?
id = self.mw.col.decks.id(deck)
